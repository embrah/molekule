      <p>The EPA states indoor air is up to 5x more polluted than outdoor air. Pollutants are trapped inside where they concentrate and multiply to harmful levels. Studies have shown that indoor pollution contributes to a wide variety of health issues for everyone, not just asthma and allergy sufferers.</p>

        <h1>Molekule doesn’t capture pollutants, it eliminates them.</h1>

        <h1>The science of clean air.</h1>
        <p>Molekule disassembles and converts pollutants into harmless elements that are meant to be in the air. This is done by creating a catalytic reaction that happens when a nanoparticle-coated filter is activated by light. Pollutants are broken down into their most basic molecular components, making them safe for us to breathe.</p>

        p Molekule disassembles and converts pollutants into harmless elements that are meant to be in the air. This is done by creating a catalytic reaction that happens when a nanoparticle-coated filter is activated by light. Pollutants are broken down into their most basic molecular components, making them safe for us to breathe.
